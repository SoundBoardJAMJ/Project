OK so this how to use these files.
This git repository is going to be the main way we update files between each other.  

So everyone go to QT and go to file, New File/Project and select Applications and Qt Widgets Application.  Name it whatever you want and keep pressing next.  Include windows in kit selection so you can test it on windows at least.

Now in QT, go to edit, find your project, delete all the useless files except the .pro file.  Now right click the project folder and select add existing files.  Add all the header and cpp files from the github repository.  And voila, if you press the green button bottom left, it will compile and you can edit the code and it will edit the files.  After editing, just push the updates to git.
